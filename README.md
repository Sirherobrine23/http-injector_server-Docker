## Http Injector server

Run a ssh server and Squid proxy, all of which are saved in a user.json file to add users to the server.

In addition to the administrator having his own account with access to the container to manage. But you don't even need it because a script inside the container takes care of maintaining users alone without the need for administrator intervention.
